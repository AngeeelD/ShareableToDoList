I choose the 3rd challenge that was a TO DO LIST application with special features like:
* Users should be able to authenticate in the app in order to use application features
* Users should be able to make TO DO lists, having the capabilities to create, delete, move, check items.
* Users will be able to share with other users the TO DO lists.
* Shared documents could be modified (create new items, modify, check, move and delete current items)

##Used Technologies

* Firebase (for backend solution)

##Language
